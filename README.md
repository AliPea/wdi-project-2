Outdoorsy London

GA WDI London - Project 1

A useful app for the outdoorsy at heart!

As a vivid lover of the outdoors now living in London, I thought of doing an app that would help me (and other expats) find good areas in central London and the surrounding areas for running, hiking, rock climbing, etc.

THE APP
The purpose of Outdoorsy London is to show the user all the locations in the city where they can go for a different [array] of activities. The app is packed with loads of information on outdoorsy activities. The user simply needs to log in to view all the available options. 

API:
-I decided to make my own database by seeding in the information

WIREFRAMES:
-I preferred drafting own wireframe. Balsamiq makes sense perhaps to manage the design of a multiple paged website.

WINS:
-I understand 80 to 90% of the code, even the things that don't make a lot of 'sense'.

-Getting my app to look as I was hoping for, clean and professional.


DIFFICULTIES:
-I still find it difficult to write my own code from scratch. I feel that if what I want to do is not in one of the class examples I am unable to "say" anything on my own. 

-The control flow. I wonder what should I start with and what afterwards? I need to know better what to pseudo code and to what extent. 


FUTURE ADDITIONS:
-Add favorites to each user profile

-Real content, remove Ipusum Lorems... Add another page, with info on terrain, gear required/recommended by  season, real life weather conditions, entrance fees to parks and links to camp grounds.
